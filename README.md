## About

This project provides powerful manifests for the installation of
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) (Ruby Version Management).
In a nutshell, it supports the following conveniences:

* Defined resources for the installation of rbenvs for one or more users, shared or standalone.
* Resources for the compilation of ruby interpreters (one or many, custom or predefined ruby build definitions), under specific rbenvs, users.
* Tools for the installation of arbitrary gems under specific rbenvs.
* Infrastructure to support rbenv plugins. We have already included [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) and [rbenv-vars](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-vars) plugins.
* Resource for handling `bundler`.

## Rbenv installation

You can use the module in your manifest with the following code:

```
rbenv::install { "someuser":
  group => 'project',
  home  => '/project'
}
```

This will apply an rbenv installation under "someuser" home dir
and place it into ".rbenv". You can change the resource title to
your taste, and pass the user on which install rbenv using the
`user` parameter.

The rbenv directory can be changed by passing the "root" parameter,
that must be an absolute path.

## Ruby compilation

To compile a ruby interpreter, you use `rbenv::compile` as follows:

```
rbenv::compile { "1.9.3-p327":
  user => "someuser",
  home => "/project",
}
```

The resource title is used as the ruby version, but if you have
multiple rubies under multiple users, you'll have to define them
explicitly:

```
rbenv::compile { "foo/1.8.7":
  user => "foo",
  ruby => "1.8.7-p370",
}

rbenv::compile { "bar/1.8.7":
  user => bar",
  ruby => "1.8.7-p370",
}
```

`rbenv rehash` is performed each time a new ruby or a new gem is
installed.

You can use the `global => true` parameter to set an interpreter as the
default (`rbenv global`) one for the given user. Please note that only one global
is allowed, duplicate resources will be defined if you specify
multiple global ruby version.

You can also provide a custom build definition to ruby-build by
specifying a `source` that can either be a `puppet:` source or
a file to be downloaded using `wget`:

```
rbenv::compile { "patched-ree":
  user   => "someuser",
  home   => "/project",
  source => "puppet://path-to-definition"
}
```

## Gem installation

You can install and keep gems updated for a specific ruby interpreter:

```
rbenv::gem { "unicorn":
  user => "foobarbaz",
  ruby => "1.9.3-p327",
}
```

Gems are handled using a custom Package provider that handles gems,
somewhat inspired by Puppet's Package one - thus `absent` and `latest`
work as expected.

## rbenv plugins

To add a plugin to a rbenv installation, you use `rbenv::plugin` as follows:

```
rbenv::plugin { "my-plugin":
  user   => "someuser",
  source => "git://github.com/user/my-plugin.git"
}
```

There's also a built-in resource to add [rbenv-vars](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-vars)
for a user:

```
rbenv::plugin::rbenvvars { "someuser":
  # Optional:
  # source => "git://path-to-your/custom/rbenv-vars.git"
}
```

*NOTICE: `rbenv::install` automatically requires [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
to compile rubies, if you want to use a different repository, you can specify
the resource on a separate manifest:*

```
rbenv::plugin::rubybuild { "someuser":
  source => "git://path-to-your/git/repo"
}
```

## Install module from puppet forge

You can install the latest release of this module by using the following
command:

```
puppet module install alup-rbenv
```

## Usage with Vagrant

A simple way to test this module is by using the
[Vagrant](http://http://vagrantup.com/) library.

An example of a Vagrantfile:

```
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
   config.vm.box = "lucid32"
   config.vm.provision :puppet, :facter => { "osfamily" => "debian" }, :module_path => "modules" do |puppet|
     puppet.manifests_path = "manifests"
     puppet.manifest_file  = "base.pp"
     puppet.options        = %w[ --libdir=\\$modulepath/rbenv/lib ]
   end
end
```

The `--libdir=\\$modulepath/rbenv/lib` argument is important to make
puppet aware of the rbenvgem custom provider and type.
